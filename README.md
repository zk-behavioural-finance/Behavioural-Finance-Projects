# Behavioral Finance Projects 📊🧠

This repository is dedicated to exploring **behavioral finance and market psychology** through data analysis, quantitative modeling, and backtesting.  

The goal: combine **finance + psychology + data science** to uncover how human behavior drives markets.

## 🔑 Focus Areas
- Behavioral biases (loss aversion, overconfidence, herding, attention effects)
- Market sentiment analysis (Reddit, Twitter, news)
- Quantitative trading models with a behavioral twist
- Visualization and storytelling for financial data

## 📂 Project Roadmap

### 1. Sentiment vs. Volatility (Starter Project)
- Hypothesis: spikes in social media sentiment predict higher next-day volatility.
- Data: Yahoo Finance (prices), Reddit/Twitter (sentiment).
- Techniques: regression, rolling volatility, sentiment scoring.

### 2. Attention and Mean Reversion
- Hypothesis: stocks with extreme investor attention (volume + chatter) show short-term reversal.
- Data: price + volume + sentiment.
- Techniques: signal construction, backtesting with transaction costs.

### 3. Replication Study
- Reproduce results from a published behavioral finance paper using modern data.
- Goal: validate findings and compare across market conditions.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

## 📈 Example Output (planned)
- Time-series plots of price vs sentiment
- Regression tables with behavioral insights
- Simple backtests with performance charts
